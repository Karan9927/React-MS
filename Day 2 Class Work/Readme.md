## Explaination
-This React application creates a webpage with the following structure:

-The main heading (h1Tag) displays "Learn Web Development."

-The first paragraph (p1Tag) provides a welcome message and an introduction to the MDN learning area. This paragraph is enclosed in a div with the class "firstDiv."

-An anchor tag (aTag) is created with a link to the MDN website. This link is then used in the second paragraph (p2Tag), which talks about the aim of the MDN area and encourages users to explore more on the MDN website. This paragraph is enclosed in a div with the class "secondDiv."

-The third paragraph (p3Tag) emphasizes the challenges faced by complete beginners in web development and assures support in the learning process. This paragraph is enclosed in a div with the class "lastDiv."

-Finally, all these elements are grouped within a main container (container), and the entire structure is rendered to the HTML root element with the ID "root" using React.
